Financial literacy is the possession of the set of skills and knowledge that allows an individual to make informed and effective decisions with all of their financial resources. Understanding basic financial concepts allows people to know how to navigate in the financial system. People with appropriate financial literacy training make better financial decisions and manage money better than those without such training.

Key concepts of financial literacy include:

Budgeting: Creating a plan to spend your money. This spending plan is called a budget.

Compound Interest: Interest calculated on the initial principal, which also includes all of the accumulated interest from previous periods.

Debt Management: Understanding the cost of borrowing and how to pay off debts effectively.

Emergency Fund: Setting aside money to cover unexpected financial surprises.

The lack of financial literacy may lead to a number of poor financial decisions that can have negative consequences on the financial well-being of an individual.
